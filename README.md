# The-Storybook-Project

In this project, I decided to go with a storybook utilizing p5.js. I chose this story because it was something my mom sang to me in childhood. I used pictures from a nursery rhyme video, and I used a picture of a train to get across the point of the train smashing the worm. This was a fun little project! I hope you enjoy it!

The index.html includes all the code needed to play the nursery rhyme in the background.
The script.js includes the rest of the code that is very important and creates in interaction such as the flipping of the pages, the images on the screen, the nursey rhyme playing in the background, and much more.

These are the images I used in the project:
